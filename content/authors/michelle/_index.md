Michelle Porter is the Director of the Centre on Aging at the University of Manitoba, a position she has held since 2015. She is also a Professor in the Faculty of Kinesiology and Recreation Management.  Dr. Porter is a leader in the age-friendly university movement, and was instrumental in UM becoming one of the world’s first age-friendly universities (Canada’s first). She holds executive positions with provincial and national organizations, including the Transportation Options Network for Seniors (TONS) in Manitoba.  For several years she has been involved with an international research team studying older drivers. Her aging-related work spans ageism, quality of life in long-term care, WHO’s healthy aging action plan, age-friendly environments, and an international project on artificial intelligence and autonomous vehicles. Michelle’s BPHE (Laurentian University), MSc (Community Health, University of Toronto) and PhD (Kinesiology, UWO) were capped by a multi-site MRC Post-Doctoral Fellowship in Boston and Scandinavia. Michelle is a fellow of the Gerontological Society of America.
