Susan is Professor of Technologies and Informatics at the Institute for Transport Studies, University of Leeds and a Fellow of The Alan Turing Institute. She leads a programme of research into large scale data analytics and the role of new forms of technology enabled data in developing sustainable transport policy.

A statistician by discipline, she researches within the Intelligent Transport Systems field. Recently this has concerned the use of new and emerging data forms, social media, mobility profiling and the role of web enabled technologies in the transport sector. Her current interests lie in understanding the wider impacts of ICT enabled mobility infrastructure (such as health, energy and carbon impacts), the governance of micro-level user-generated data, and understanding incentivisation as part of behaviourally orientated demand management.

Susan is a Co-Investigator for the ESRC Consumer Data Research Centre (CDRC) a member of the Leeds Institute for Data Analytics (LIDA) and the University of Leeds Centre for Integrated Energy Research (CIER) funded by a substantive tranche of University strategic funding
