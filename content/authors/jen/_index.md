My research interests relate to the interplay of transport, mobility and health in urban environments, specifically the question of how day-to-day practices, social structure and geographical context influence inequalities in health and well-being. Throughout my research, I develop methodological innovations in processing both established and novel data sources (big data) for strategic applications in urban policy, transport planning and public health. I frequently work and engage with international, national and local organisations operating in these areas.
