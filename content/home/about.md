The <strong>RAIM (Responsible Automation for Inclusive Mobility)</strong> project addresses how an on-demand autonomous vehicle system might be integrated within public transport systems to meet the needs of older populations, and lead to improved social, economic, and health outcomes. To achieve this, we will employ a range of methods â€“ integrating focus group perspectives and data analystics into AI-generated population simulations and supply optimisation. 

The project will focus on two settings - in the West Midlands, UK and Winnipeg, Canada - where we will work closely with local people and partners. The project runs until 2023, and is funded by British (ESRC, EPSRC, MRC, AHRC) and Canadian (CIHR, SSHRC, NSERC) research councils under the Canada-UK Artificial Intelligence Initiative. 

To find out more about the project, please see our About page, or about us through the Project Team page.
